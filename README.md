Description
===========

The **emender-vim** plug-in adds syntax highlighting for plain-text reports
generated by Emender to Vim.

Installation
============

Installing the Plug-in Using Vundle
-----------------------------------

To install the **emender-vim** plug-in by using the
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) plug-in manager, add the
following line to your **~/.vimrc**:

    Bundle 'emender/emender-vim'

Then run the following command in Vim:

    :BundleInstall

Installing the Plug-in Using Pathogen
-------------------------------------

[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) looks for Vim files in
the **~/.vim/bundle/** directory. To make sure that this directory exists,
type the following command at a shell prompt:

    install -d ~/.vim/bundle/

To install the **emender-vim** plug-in by using Pathogen, change to the
**~/.vim/bundle/** directory and clone this repository there:

    git clone https://github.com/emender/emender-vim.git

Installing the Syntax File Manually
-----------------------------------

Vim looks for its configuration files in the **~/.vim/** directory. To make
sure that this directory exists, type the following at a shell prompt:

    mkdir ~/.vim/

To install the **emender-vim** plug-in, change to the directory with your
local copy of this repository and run the following command:

    cp -R * ~/.vim/

This command copies all files and directories to the **~/.vim/** directory.

Configuration
=============

Enabling Syntax Highlighting
----------------------------

To enable syntax highlighting in the current session, run the following Vim
command:

    :syntax on

To enable syntax highlighting permanently, add the following line to your
**~/.vimrc** file:

    syntax on

You can also explicitly enable file type detection by adding the following
line to this file:

    filetype on

For more information on how to enable and configure syntax highlighting in
Vim, refer to the official
[Vim Documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html).
